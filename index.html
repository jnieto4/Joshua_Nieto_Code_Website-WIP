        <h3>Parallel Fractal Image Generator (C++ & MPI)</h3>
        <p>Built a high-performance fractal generator using C++ and MPI to compute and render complex images in parallel. The program distributes pixel calculations across multiple processes to dramatically improve performance on multi-core systems. It outputs the final result as a BMP image, demonstrating skills in parallel computing, memory management, and image processing.</p>

        <h3>Personal Portfolio Website (HTML & CSS & JavaScript)</h3>
        <p>This is my personal portfolio website, developed from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website serves as a showcase of my skills, experience, and projects, providing potential employers with a comprehensive view of my work. The website includes responsive design, interactive elements, and a user-friendly layout. The goal was to create an aesthetically pleasing and functional space where I can display my achievements, highlight key projects, and provide easy access to my GitHub repository and contact information.</p>
